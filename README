The Void Extractor
==================

Extractor for the data files of the game "The Void". 

Usage
=====

Datafiles come in the form of .vfs files in The Void, each of those
bundles a directory in uncompressed form. Modding should be possible
by simply having a plain directory with the same name next to the .vfs
file.

You can extract everything (--extract-all), name files to extract
explicitly or extract by glob pattern (--glob "*.ogg"). Example usage
would look like this:

  ./thevoid-extractor.py \
    -v "/win/Program Files/The Void/data/Sounds.vfs" \
    --extract --targetdir data/ -g "*.ogg"

If --targetdir is not given files will be extracted to the current
working directory.
